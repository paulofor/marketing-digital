However, given that males are less sensitive to chemosensory cues, making such assessments of a female's fertility by means of kissing may be more difficult, and we suggest that males may require greater salivary exchange to facilitate assessments of female fertility and, for that reason, prefer wetter, open mouth, tongue kisses.

We hypothesize that in long-term relationships, both sexes will place equal importance on kissing, especially with saliva exchange, to facilitate sexual arousal and receptivity. On the other hand, when it comes to short-term relations, females may be less inclined to kiss and exchange saliva if they choose not to have intercourse. We also hypothesize that both sexes may be more jealous if they know their partner kissed another person with tongue contact, since this style of kissing is associated with the intent to arouse and could therefore lead to sexual infidelity.
The present study provides a descriptive account of kissing behavior by measuring attitudes, preferences, and sex differences among a large sample of college students, and considers kissing within the context of both short-term and long-term mating situations. Specifically, we examined several features of kissing behavior that include different kissing styles (i.e., open mouth kisses, wetness, tongue contact), kissing and sexual behavior, bonding and relationship status, and the attractiveness and physical traits of kissing partners.
Materials and Methods
A series of three studies approved by the local Institutional Review Board were conducted using anonymous questionnaires administered to students enrolled in psychology courses at the University at Albany, State University of New York. A total of 1,041 respondents completed one of three anonymous questionnaires in a classroom setting. In order to assure that responses were based, in part, on first-hand experience, participants who indicated that they had never romantically kissed another person were excluded for the analyses. Since we were examining opposite sex relations as it relates to mating strategies, we only included those who indicated a preference for kissing “only” or “mostly” members of the opposite sex.

Study 3
Methods
The third study examined the perceived importance of kissing practices, attitudes toward kissing, and an assessment of kissing partners. This questionnaire was completed by another sample of 267 undergraduate students (71 males and 196 females), 92.8% were in the age range of 18–24 with the remainder being 25 and or above. All participants reported having experienced romantically kissing and only those who indicated a preference for kissing “only” or “mostly” the opposite sex were included for the analysis, yielding a sample of 250 (69 males and 181 females). Of the participants, 12% reported kissing 1–2 partners, 21% 3–5 partners, 28% 6–10 partners, 23% 11–20 partners, and 16% kissed 21 or more partners. Sixty-one percent indicated that they were currently in a committed romantic relationship.

At the moment of a kiss, there is an exceedingly rich and complex exchange of postural, tactile, and chemical cues. As evidence for just how biologically important this exchange can be, one of us (Gallup) recently completed an unrelated survey which included the question “Have you ever found yourself attracted to someone, only to discover after kissing them for the first time that you were no longer interested?” Out of 58 male respondents, 59% answered “yes,” and 66% of 122 female respondents also answered in the affirmative. Thus, what transpires during an initial kiss can have a profound effect on the future of that relationship. Perhaps kissing in these instances may activate evolved mechanisms that function to discourage reproduction among individuals who could be genetically incompatible.

Several findings support our second hypothesis that both males and females use kissing as a bonding mechanism and place more importance on kissing long-term than short-term partners. First, both sexes felt that kissing a long-term partner creates greater emotional closeness. Second, both sexes agreed that kissing after sex creates more of a bond with their long-term partner than short-term partner, and they indicated wanting to kiss their long-term partner after experiencing an orgasm more often than a short-term partner. Third, both sexes were less likely to have sex without kissing a long-term partner than a short-term partner. Our data, however, suggest that the connection between kissing and bonding may not be driven by a conscious component. The majority of males and females agreed they would not begin a relationship with someone simply because they were a good kisser.

Kissing styles that enhance salivary exchange are seen as a way to increase the arousal of a partner. Both sexes wanted to have more tongue contact before having sex with a long-term partner than a short-term partner. As predicted, both sexes also reported that they would be more jealous if they saw their partner kiss someone else with tongue contact, suggesting, that a tongue kiss signals intent to engage in sexual intercourse with the extrapair partner.

It is important to acknowledge several limitations of our study. Our sample consisted of mainly college-aged students and these findings may not necessarily generalize to older or more heterogeneous adults. Furthermore, the functions of kissing proposed here may not be the same for those who are married and/or have children. This study is also limited by the fact that we relied on self-reports rather than direct observation or experimental manipulations and causality cannot be inferred from our analyses. Future investigations examining the incidence of mouth contact and saliva exchange in non-sexual romantic kissing situations (e.g., parent-child kissing) would also help clarify the distinction between different categories of kissing.
Nonetheless, this study provides evidence that romantic kissing may have evolved as an adaptive courtship strategy that functions as a mate-assessment technique, a means of initiating sexual arousal and receptivity, and a way of maintaining a bonded relationship. While both sexes participate in the adaptive benefits of kissing, we found sex differences when considering the pursuit of short- versus long-term mating strategies. We suspect that overall, women place a greater importance on kissing not only to make more judicious mate assessments, but for those in committed relationships kissing is used (wittingly or not) to update, monitor, and assess the status of their partner's continuing commitment (or lack thereof) to the relationship. Males tend to employ romantic kissing as a means of increasing sexual receptivity and gaining sexual access, to affect conflict resolution, and to possibly monitor the fertility of his mate.
